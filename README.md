# DBMS

Aim: 
Implement Database creation for a Hospital and run SQL queries to simplify the hospital's administrative process.
Prerequisite: Object Oriented Concepts, SQL queries.

Outcome: 
After successful completion of this practical students will be able to
•	Features of database management system 
•	Analyze project requirements
•	Understand Structure of Project (Object Hierarchy).
•	Database structure, gathering required data

Description: 1. Entity sets include DOCTOR, PATIENT, BILL and ROOM
2. Attributes associated with DOCTOR such as phone number, name, address, department etc. Attributes associated with PATIENT such as address, age, name, patient id etc. Attributes associated with BILL such as Bill number, doctor charges, room charges. Attributes associated with ROOM such as room type, room id.
3. Relationships between DOCTOR who Treats the PATIENT, PATIENT who is Issued a BILL and Assigned a ROOM.

Conclusion: 
By creating tables to enter the details of the Doctors, the patients and the patient’s billing details we eliminate any errors and mistakes that the Hospital Management can make. Making entries into the database is made simpler and viewing the patient’s basic information and case information is also made simpler.
The project Hospital Management System (HMS) is for
computerizing the working in a hospital. The software
takes care of all the requirements of an average
hospital and is capable to provide easy and effective
storage of information related to patients that come up
to the hospital.

Future Scope: 
There lies immense scope in implementing Hospital Management System or Patient Registration Systems.  It can also help generate test reports; provide prescription details
including various tests, check-up and medicines
prescribed to patient and doctor. It also provides
injection details and billing facility.
• The system also provides the facility of backup as per
the requirement.
